# SPD-Autoencoder

An autoencoder implementation for Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices using PyTorch.

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning autoencoder specifically designed for learning representations of SPD matrices. The model can be used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and analysis of SPD matrix data.

## Features

- Custom SPD matrix data generation
- Neural network-based autoencoder architecture
- Visualization tools for latent space analysis
- Error distribution analysis
- Mixed SPD data experiment capabilities

## Experiments
The project includes experiments with mixed SPD data using different mixing ratios to analyze the model's behavior and representation capabilities.
